Abstract

   HTTP proxies can operate several different kinds of access services.
   This specification provides a format for identifying a collection of
   such services.

1.  Introduction

   In HTTP/1.1, forward proxy service was originally defined in two
   ways: absolute-uri form (encrypted at most hop-by-hop), and HTTP
   CONNECT (potentially encrypted end-to-end).  Both of these services
   were effectively origin-scoped: the access service was a property of
   the origin, not associated with any particular path.

   Recently, a variety of new standardized proxy-like services have
   emerged for HTTP.  These new services are defined by URI templates
   that produce one or more distinct paths for each service, allowing
   distinct instances of the same service type to be served by a single
   origin.  These services include:

   *  DNS over HTTPS

   *  CONNECT-UDP

   *  CONNECT-IP

   *  Oblivious HTTP

   This specification provides a unified format for describing a
   collection of such access services, and a mechanism for reaching such
   services when the initial information contains only an HTTP origin.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Format

   An access service collection is defined by a JSON dictionary
   containing keys specified in the corresponding registry (Section 6).
   Inclusion of each key is OPTIONAL.

   The "dns", "udp", and "ip" keys are each defined to hold a JSON
   dictionary containing the key "template" with a value that is a URI
   template suitable for configuring DNS over HTTPS, CONNECT-UDP, or
   CONNECT-IP, respectively.  The "ohai" key contains a dictionary whose
   "request" key contains the URI of an Oblivious HTTP "request
   resource".

   For example, a description making use of all four initial keys might
   look like:

   {
     "dns": {
       "template": "https://doh.example.com/dns-query{?dns}",
     },
     "udp": {
       "template": "https://proxy.example.org:4443/masque{?target_host,target_port}"
     },
     "ip": {
       "template": "https://proxy.example.org:4443/masque{?target,ip_proto}"
     },
     "ohai": {
       "request": "https://example.com/ohai/"
     }
   }

4.  Discovery from an Origin

   In cases where the HTTP access service is identified only by an
   origin (e.g. when configured as a Secure Web Proxy), operators can
   publish an associated access service collection at the path "/.well-
   known/access-services", with the Content-Type "application/json".

   Clients MAY fetch this access description and use the indicated
   services (in addition to any origin-scoped services) automatically.
   Clients MUST refresh the description periodically in accordance with
   its indicated HTTP cache lifetime.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to open a Specification Required registry entitled
   "HTTP Access Service Descriptors", with the following initial
   contents:

                        +======+=================+
                        | Key  | Specification   |
                        +======+=================+
                        | dns  | (This document) |
                        +------+-----------------+
                        | udp  | (This document) |
                        +------+-----------------+
                        | ip   | (This document) |
                        +------+-----------------+
                        | ohai | (This document) |
                        +------+-----------------+

                                 Table 1

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "Well-Known URIs"
   registry

   +=================+============+=========+===========+==============+
   | URI Suffix      | Change     |Reference| Status    | Related      |
   |                 | Controller |         |           | Information  |
   +=================+============+=========+===========+==============+
   | access-services | IETF       |(This    | permanent | Sub-registry |
   |                 |            |document)|           | at (link)    |
   +-----------------+------------+---------+-----------+--------------+
